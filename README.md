# Welcome to my assignment

## Introduction
This assignment was made based on what I liked. I made this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
There're many problem before this website is deployed.
First, I stuck to saving the dark and light modes to the local storage. To save them to local storage, I have to watch YouTube videos step by step. Because the subject of saving to the local storage hasn't been learned yet. If I miss the step, the dark and light modes can't be saved to local storage.
Second, I stuck to making the carousel proper and nice. I already made the carousel, but it's not nice, and I don't like it. So I watch many videos of carousels, but there are none that I like. So I decided to make another type of carousel that is more simple, and I like it.
And finally, all the problems were already solved and the website was deployed using Netlify.
